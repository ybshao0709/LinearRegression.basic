`Linear Regression` is a commonly used statistical method for modelling the relationship between an outcome and one or more predictors. In parctical, it can be used for prediction, as well as quantifying the strength of the linearly association between the outcome and the explanatory variables. 

`LinearRegression.basic` is 

The existing `stats::lm` in `R` is an powerful function that can help us fit the basic linear regression model, and we can obtain the point estimate of $\beta$

Therefore, we develop an new R package `LinearRegression.basic`,
